										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI emergence is a topic that has dominated industry-wide conversation all year long. Through increased adoption of generative AI, organizations are strategizing other useful incorporations to optimize business processes and enhance service capabilities – task automation, data cleaning, cyber monitoring, and more.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/the%20economic%20potential%20of%20generative%20ai%20the%20next%20productivity%20frontier/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier.pdf">McKinsey</a>, the AI market is projected to hit $1.8 trillion by 2030, creating vast opportunities to weave AI into enterprise-wide activity and innovate with a competitive edge. With peaking interest around AI enhancement, organizations are challenged to leverage emerging tech capabilities amid a prevalent shortage across cyber, cloud, and AI resources. How should organizations balance both concerns, leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence while addressing gaps in high-demand tech talent? Navigating the intricacies of AI emergence could be a key difference-maker on the path to optimization and business evolution. Let’s explore how.</p>
<h2><strong>The Economic Impact of AI</strong></h2>
<p>With trillions of dollars projected in economic impact, the opportunity to apply AI across enterprise functions continues to expand. From the job creation of AI specialists, network engineers and support staff to enhanced automation and ChatBot capabilities, AI drives widespread value to advance business processes, service offerings, and customer experiences. Through key tech talent, organizations can unlock the full power of AI as an enterprise tool and seize return on investment.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/artificial-intelligence/worldwide">market</a> for artificial intelligence has reached about $184 billion. Over the last five years alone, generative AI investment holds a compound growth rate of 74 percent. This dramatic growth in AI technology underscores the current and future value organizations anticipate capturing. One of the primary drivers of economic return on AI investment is automation. Through automation, which allows technology and machines to perform tasks with minimal human intervention, provides more time and resources to focus on complex strategic concerns instead of tedious, repetitive activity. This allows organizations to shift more attention to larger challenges such as business generation and customer experience.</p>
<p>With this shift, organizations can maximize productivity, transform business models and increase profits. The cross-industry impact is palpable. For example, AI in manufacturing enhances assembly line efficiency and production, whereas in financial services it helps with fraud detection and investment identification. In marketing, it simplifies content creation and information gathering, while in technology it streamlines software development and data management. These innovations not only improve efficiency but also contribute to economic growth across industries.</p>
<h2><strong>AI&#8217;s Impact on the Skills Landscape</strong></h2>
<p>To accomplish AI adoption goals, organizations need leadership buy-in and the appropriate tech talent to develop, configure and maintain these capabilities. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the tech workforce is expected to grow twice as the fast as the overall U.S. workforce over the next 10 years. With over 600,000 <a href="/website/insights/strategies-to-address-it-workforce-shortage/">unfilled openings</a> in cybersecurity alone, these skills shortages can be found across the tech landscape, including for artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI is fundamentally altering the nature of work, leading to a growing demand for skills that align with AI-enabled systems. This combination of AI market growth and tech labor shortage presents opportunistic terrain for organizations to navigate in their AI adoption journey.</p>
<h3><u>Upskilling and Reskilling the Workforce</u></h3>
<p>AI emergence is creating new opportunities for upskilling and reskilling. Personalized training platforms, often powered by AI themselves, are helping professionals acquire the skills needed to thrive in an AI-friendly world. For instance, AI-based learning systems can assess individual knowledge gaps and tailor educational content accordingly. This enables professionals to understand technological trends and ensure businesses have the talent needed to remain competitive in the evolving AI landscape. Here are some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/libertbarry/2024/08/21/how-to-build-an-ai-skilled-workforce/">proven</a> approaches for organizations to upskill their staff:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess Workforce Needs and Goals:</strong> Conduct a skills inventory to understand your workforce&#8217;s existing competencies and identify gaps. Determine which roles will benefit most from AI and ML skills, such as data scientists, developers, business analysts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Customize Tailored Pathways:</strong> Develop curated resources such as online tutorials, books, webinars, and industry reports for different job functions. For example, technical roles can focus advanced skills like programming, data modeling, and algorithm development, while for non-technical can center around high-level AI/ML concepts and user-centric capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Pair employees with internal AI/ML experts for mentorship and create collaborative peer-to-peer groups where employees can share insights and learn together.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow Learning:</strong> Assign projects that allow employees to apply their new AI/ML skills in real-time. Start with small AI/ML pilot projects to build confidence and demonstrate tangible results.</li>
<li><strong>Measure and Refine: </strong>Measure how upskilling initiatives contribute to achieving your organization’s objective through assessments, surveys and project outcomes. Continuously refine training programs to address evolving needs and skills gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Staff Augmentation: </strong>Partner with an IT Staffing firm to supplement internal staff supporting AI capabilities. Augmented resources can lead and train workforces on emerging tech such as AI, ML, natural language processing, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite tech advancement, the rapid pace of AI adoption has created a considerable skills gap. Businesses often struggle to find employees with the technical expertise needed to implement and manage AI systems. Collaboration is needed to address this gap through personalized training programs, accessible education initiatives, and IT staff augmentation.</p>
<h2><strong>Human-AI Collaboration and Responsible Usage</strong></h2>
<p>With the benefits of AI impact and its projected market growth, it is critical for AI to be developed responsibly with proven guardrails and foster collaborative human-AI relationships. The risk versus reward factor of AI is not something to take for granted, with the looming threat of job displacement and unchecked biases. The right balance of automation, collaboration and safe development is pertinent for AI sustainability.</p>
<h3><u>Risks of Job Displacement</u></h3>
<p>One of the most pressing concerns surrounding AI is the potential for job displacement. According to McKinsey, by 2030, up to 30% of jobs globally could be automated. Roles in sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, and administrative support are particularly vulnerable as automation continues to advance. However, history demonstrates that technological revolutions often lead to the creation of new roles in unexpected areas. For example, the advent of personal computers eliminated some jobs but created entirely new fields like IT support and software development. While automation threatens routine jobs, it simultaneously creates demand for roles in AI development, data analysis, and systems management. Balancing these shifts requires reskilling programs to help workers transition into emerging fields, ensuring the workforce remains adaptable, even in an AI-driven economy.</p>
<h3><u>AI Ethics</u></h3>
<p>The ethical use of artificial intelligence is critical as its applications expand across industries. Responsible AI emphasizes fairness, transparency, and accountability to prevent biases and discrimination embedded in algorithms. Ethical AI ensures that systems respect privacy and comply with data protection laws while minimizing potential harms such as misinformation, copyright infringement or surveillance misuse. Collaboration between developers, policymakers, and stakeholders is essential to establish robust governance frameworks. Additionally, organizations must adopt practices such as ethical AI training and explainable AI to maintain trust and alignment with societal values.</p>
<h3><u>Critical Infrastructure Framework</u></h3>
<p>AI is revolutionizing how critical infrastructure—such as energy grids, transportation networks, and water systems—is secured and managed. By leveraging predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and advanced cybersecurity measures, AI enables faster detection of risks, prevention of disruptions, and enhanced resilience against natural and man-made threats.</p>
<p>“AI offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve the strength and resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure, and we must seize it while minimizing its potential harms,” said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas, “The choices organizations and individuals involved in creating AI make today will determine the impact this technology will have in our critical infrastructure tomorrow.”</p>
<p>DHS issued a comprehensive <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/24_1114_dhs_ai-roles-and-responsibilities-framework-508.pdf">framework</a> for using Artificial Intelligence in Critical Infrastructure. This offers a tremendous opportunity to responsibly leverage AI to support and improve the nation’s critical infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">From interrupting emergency hospital services to compromising sensitive information such as social security numbers, cybercriminals are persistently deploying ransomware to block data access, disrupt business operations, and receive lucrative payments at the threat of further damage. For Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a time of year where special attention is brought to a host of cyber-related topics and events, we spotlight ransomware as one of the most prominent and damaging cyber threats that bad actors deploy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although around for decades, ransomware has evolved into a sophisticated scheme that not only interrupts systems and operations, but also threatens to expose sensitive data to a sprawling network of cybercriminals seeking to exploit this information for their own gain. Understanding the significant risk posed by ransomware and proactive measures organizations can take is a step towards addressing this powerful cyber threat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What is Ransomware?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As described by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&amp;mhq=ransomware">IBM</a>, </span><span data-contrast="auto">ransomware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is malware that holds sensitive data or devices hostage, unless the victim pays a ransom to cybercriminals. Through this method, bad actors not only disrupt essential operations and business functions, but also generate income, further incentivizing their nefarious schemes. These schemes account for roughly 20% of all cyber-related attacks and untold amounts in fiduciary damage as many organizations are reluctant to report how much they have paid in ransom (this figure is </span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-cost-of-ransomware-around-the-globe-to-go-beyond-265-billion-in-the-next-decade/"><span data-contrast="none">estimated</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to reach $265 billion by 2031). </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like most cyber-attacks, ransomware started simply, exchanging ransom for encryption keys to regain access to impacted systems and devices. Through proactive backup capabilities, victims can thwart these attempts and even bypass ransom payments.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Over time, ransomware has grown more sophisticated, evolving into double- and triple- extortion attacks that not only hold systems hostage, but also threaten to release sensitive company and customer data to other cybercriminals on the dark web. This heightened threat, along with Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), strengthens the potency of ransomware attacks and leaves many orgs vulnerable to the next disruptive cyber breach.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ransomware attacks are indiscriminate, impacting a wide range of verticals and enterprises such as SolarWinds, AT&amp;T, Comcast, MGM Resorts, Colonial Pipeline, US Department of Energy, UK National Health Service, Kronos, Kaseya, Travelex, etc. In the case of National Public Data, a leading background check provider, over </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/billions-records-social-security-numbers-and-data-stolen-allegedly.html?&amp;doc=108044983"><span data-contrast="none">2.9 billion personal records</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, including 270 million social security numbers were compromised and published online. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If that is not alarming enough, former FBI cyber lead John Riggi described UMC Hospital’s recent ransomware </span><span data-contrast="auto">cyber incident</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as a threat to </span><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/cyber-security-expert-calls-ransomware-attack-on-umc-a-national-security-issue/ar-AA1rlzKI"><span data-contrast="none">national security</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, diverting emergency response services to those in need. This included rerouting emergency patients to other hospital facilities, unable to receive care at UMC which is the only Level 1 trauma center within a 400-mile radius.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“When hospitals are attacked, lives are threatened,” said Riggi.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With ransomware and other crippling cyber-attacks, bad actors can exploit critical infrastructure and put lives at risk, further underscoring the importance of having strong protections in place to suppress this persistent threat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><i><span data-contrast="auto">Attack Vectors</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What makes organizations succumb to ransomware? There are numerous attack vectors cybercriminals use to embed ransomware and bring business operations to a standstill. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This includes </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">phishing, smishing, and vishing</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">, in which victims are conned into providing credentials or sensitive information from targeted, individualized outreach via email, text message, or phone call. Through unwitting collaboration, victims offer access into enterprise systems, networks, and devices, which is all a bad actor needs to cause massive damage. This tried and tested method is highly effective, especially with increased reliance on AI and </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/tech/ai-voice-cloning-scam-warning/index.html"><span data-contrast="none">voice mimicking</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> capabilities, strengthening the believability and efficiency of these cons. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another common attack vector is </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) compromise</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. As reliance continues to grow on remote and hybrid work options, providing added flexibility and accessibility for organizations and their workforces, it has also become a point of vulnerability that bad actors have successfully exploited. When compromised, RDP grants bad actors direct access to, and complete control of, the impacted company device, bypassing the need to deploy a phishing/smishing scheme, code malware, or exploit additional points of entry. Through this method, cybercriminals can take down company servers with relative ease, highlighting the need for protections such as complex, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication. Otherwise, cybercriminals have an open runway into company systems and spread ransomware with little resistance.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, a notable attack vector that gained notoriety with the SolarWinds and Kaseya breaches is targeting the supply chain. Through third-party vendors and solution providers that organizations rely upon cybercriminals can deploy </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">supply chain attacks</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> that widen the net of their breaches across many enterprises simultaneously. In the case of the groundbreaking SolarWinds breach, thousands of organizations were impacted, interrupting mission critical systems and access to sensitive data. The scale of supply chain attacks poses a sobering reality on the interconnectedness and vulnerability of the digital landscape.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Considering the evolution and prevalence of ransomware attacks, as well as the myriad of attack vectors bad actors have at their disposal, the need for strong, proven cybersecurity solutions is as important now than ever before. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protections against Ransomware</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the increased effectiveness and scale of ransomware attacks, what solutions have been proven to protect against this active cyber threat? The answer is multi-faceted, relying on a robust combination of measures and countermeasures to respond to ransomware attacks and prevent them from happening in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

Proven solutions include maintaining frequent, encrypted backups stored offline or in the cloud, and regularly testing recovery processes. Implementing a comprehensive disaster recovery plan ensures that organizations can quickly resume operations after an attack, minimizing downtime and data loss. Realizing this, cybercriminals even deploy ransomware against backup storage capabilities to further disrupt operations and stifle recovery.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Widespread outages caused by a faulty update to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/crowdstrike-global-outage-explained-rcna162683">CrowdStrike’s</a> endpoint protection platform has caused enterprise decision-makers to think harder about their business continuity and disaster recovery planning. A loud message was sent across many industries that proven contingencies are needed to protect organizations, recover important data and restore business essential capabilities. This planning can include investing in more controllable, internal data center solutions, more convenient, third-party cloud-based offerings, or a more comprehensive hybrid approach that covers all bases. Regardless of the options organizations choose to explore, it’s clear that relying solely on vendor business continuity planning to protect critical operations and accessibility may not be enough.</p>
<h2><strong>Enterprise Vulnerabilities </strong></h2>
<p>The CrowdStrike outage served as a clear wake-up call disrupting access to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/crowdstrike-says-hackers-are-threatening-leak-sensitive-information-ad-rcna163675">8.5 million Windows devices</a>, one of the largest computer crashes in history. This impacted operations across industries such as aviation, emergency response, financial services, broadcasting, manufacturing and much more. A simple coding error brought enterprises and government operations across the globe to a standstill, exposing the fragility of our interconnected digital landscape, and more awareness of vulnerabilities which threaten to disrupt business.</p>
<p>The first thought that may come to mind when thinking of business continuity and disaster recovery is in its name – disaster scenarios. This includes events such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, wildfires, blizzards, earthquakes, mudslides, etc. In natural disaster scenarios, business continuity ensures that organizations are still able to perform business operations and effective recovery plans are in place.</p>
<p>However, the CrowdStrike outage underlined the importance of considering all forms of enterprise vulnerabilities which can disrupt operations, such as cyber breaches, network failures, compromised infrastructure, and third-party system outages. In today&#8217;s business environment, the list of disruptions organizations must be prepared for is expansive and evolving.  No matter the event, orgs can find exceptional value when they prioritize business continuity planning and disaster recovery practices.</p>
<h2><strong>Importance of Business Continuity &amp; Disaster Recovery</strong></h2>
<p>Although business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) are pegged together because of their close relation as risk management protocols, key differences exist between them. What are these differences and why is BCDR important for organizations to leverage?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ucf.edu/online/leadership-management/news/business-continuity-vs-disaster-recovery/#:~:text=Business%20continuity%20focuses%20on%20keeping,IT%20infrastructure%20after%20a%20disaster.">Business continuity</a> is more of a general approach to keep mission-critical business functions operational during and after a disruption or disaster, even if physical relocation to alternate facilities or remote access is needed. This proactive plan establishes processes and people responsible for addressing a broad range of threats which can interrupt operations.</p>
<p>Disaster Recovery is a more detailed, focused approach responding to specific disaster scenarios, particularly impacting IT systems, networks and enterprise data. This response plan addresses interruptions due to massive outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, etc. DR is a subset of BC, primarily focused on recovering lost data, systems, and applications as quickly as possible, minimizing long-term damage to technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>Typically, the scope of BC plans cover all aspects of the business, including communications, human resources, supply chains, and IT services. This focuses on maintaining continuous operations from a wholistic standpoint.</p>
<p>On the other hand, DR is more technical and IT-focused, detailing specific steps for restoring hardware, software, and data. It&#8217;s mainly reactive, activated after a disaster occurs.</p>
<p>Together, BCDR provides organizations with significant advantages in the competitive marketplace. A shortlist of BCDR benefits includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Minimized downtime</u>:</strong> Critical business operations continue, even during a crisis, mitigating significant disruption and preventing extend outages.</li>
<li><strong><u>Reducing financial losses</u>:</strong> Halted operations can lead to financial challenges, as demonstrated with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/08/09/crowdstrike-is-significantly-undervalued-following-operational-crisis/">$5.4 billion loss</a> caused by the CrowdStrike outage.</li>
<li><strong><u>Enhanced risk management</u>:</strong> Identifying potential threats and establishing BCDR plans makes business more prepared for unexpected disruptions and reduces the risk of permanent data loss.</li>
<li><strong><u>Increased resiliency</u>:</strong> Enables businesses to function under adverse conditions by implementing flexible work arrangements, alternative supply chains, and temporary measures.</li>
<li><strong><u>Customer trust</u>:</strong> Establishing a strong BCDR program helps organizations maintain customer trust and brand reputation, offering dependability even in crisis moments.</li>
</ul>
<p>By having well-established BCDR plans, organizations can ensure continuity, protect their reputation, and recover swiftly from disruptions. These plans are essential for long-term stability in an increasingly volatile business landscape.</p>
<h2><strong>Proven BCDR Solutions</strong></h2>
<p>Now let’s turn to different BCDR solutions organizations can leverage to support continuous operations and enterprise resiliency. For IT operations, this typically includes solutions such as On-Prem data centers, Cloud-based data centers, and Back-up-as-a-Service. Each of these solutions offer <a href="https://www.revyz.io/blog/cloud-vs-on-premise-disaster-recovery-a-comparison">unique benefits</a> depending on an organization’s needs, infrastructure, and budget.</p>
<h3>ON-PREMISE DATA CENTERS (ON-PREM)</h3>
<p>On-premise solutions involve maintaining and managing physical servers and infrastructure within an organization’s own facilities. These data centers handle everything from backups to disaster recovery planning and require a dedicated IT team to manage.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong><em>:</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Full Control:</u></strong> Businesses have direct control over their servers, systems, and data, allowing for customization to meet specific security and compliance needs.</li>
<li><strong><u>Data Privacy:</u></strong> Since all data is stored locally, it remains entirely within the organization&#8217;s physical control, which can mitigate concerns about third-party data breaches or unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong><u>Performance:</u></strong> Localized data centers often offer faster access to data and systems since they&#8217;re on the same network infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Upfront Costs:</u></strong> On-prem solutions typically require more upfront capital for hardware, facilities, and ongoing maintenance. Additional costs include cooling, power, and staffing for management.</li>
<li><strong><u>Scalability Challenges:</u></strong> Scaling on-prem infrastructure to handle increased capacity can be time-consuming and expensive, requiring more space, hardware and proper installation.</li>
<li><strong><u>Vulnerability to Localized Disasters:</u></strong> On-prem data centers are susceptible to regional disasters (fires, floods, etc.), which could render them non-functional if the organization does not have off-site backups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS</h3>
<p>Cloud-based BCDR solutions utilize third-party cloud providers (like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) to host infrastructure, data, and applications. These solutions often include built-in redundancy, scalability, and flexibility.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong><em>:</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Scalability:</u> </strong>Cloud solutions offer on-demand scalability, allowing organizations to increase or decrease resources as needed without investing in physical hardware.</li>
<li><strong><u>Cost Efficiency:</u></strong> Cloud services often follow a pay-as-you-go model, reducing the upfront costs of infrastructure and offering more flexibility in managing expenses.</li>
<li><strong><u>Geographic Redundancy:</u></strong> Cloud providers typically store data across multiple locations, protecting against localized disasters. This ensures that data remains available even if one data center experiences a failure.</li>
<li><strong><u>Automation and Speed:</u></strong> Cloud platforms can automate many processes, such as backups and system failovers, significantly speeding up recovery times in the event of an outage.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Dependence on Internet Access:</u></strong> Since cloud services are accessed remotely, they rely on internet connectivity. Any downtime in internet service can impede access to critical systems and data.</li>
<li><strong><u>Less Control:</u></strong> Organizations may have less control over the infrastructure, which could create compliance concerns, especially in industries with strict data regulations.</li>
<li><strong><u>Data Security Concerns:</u></strong> Storing sensitive data with third-party vendors raises concerns about data security, compliance, and the potential for breaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3>BACKUP-AS-A-SERVICE (BaaS)</h3>
<p>BaaS is a specialized cloud service that automatically manages the backup of an organization’s data. It ensures that data is continuously backed up and can be quickly restored in case of system failure, data corruption, or cyberattacks.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Automated Backups:</u></strong> BaaS platforms automate data backups, ensuring that organizations always have the latest data stored without manual intervention.</li>
<li><strong><u>Cost-Effective:</u></strong> BaaS provides cost savings over traditional on-premise backups, as businesses do not need to maintain physical servers or storage devices.</li>
<li><strong><u>Remote Accessibility:</u></strong> Data backed up via BaaS is stored off-site, often in multiple locations, making it available for recovery from anywhere in case of a disaster.</li>
<li><strong><u>Reduced Management Overhead:</u></strong> With BaaS, the service provider manages the infrastructure and processes, reducing the burden on in-house IT staff.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Data Recovery Speed:</u></strong> Depending on the size of the data and internet bandwidth, restoring large amounts of data from the cloud can take time.</li>
<li><strong><u>Vendor Dependence:</u></strong> Organizations rely heavily on the service provider for both data storage and recovery. This creates risks if the provider experiences outages or disruptions.</li>
<li><strong><u>Compliance and Security Concerns:</u></strong> As with other cloud solutions, using BaaS raises potential concerns about data security and regulatory compliance, especially for sensitive or regulated data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the right BCDR solution depends on the specific needs, budget, and compliance requirements of an organization. Solutions come with their own set of benefits and drawbacks, but empowers organizations to customize and tailor to their exact needs. Many organizations even opt for hybrid solutions, blending on-prem and cloud approaches to balance control, cost, and resiliency. Regardless of the approach, having a reliable BCDR solution is proving mandatory in our evolving business and digital landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studies continue to show that companies prioritizing diversity through their ranks experience increased <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-matters-even-more-the-case-for-holistic-impact">financial success</a>, from profitability and revenue generation to new clients and market share. But that’s not all. Workplace diversity also drives cultural impact, enhancing decision-making, talent pools, retention efforts and innovation. Considering its overall positive influence, including on the bottom line, it’s striking how much the technology sector has struggled when it comes to diversity and inclusion. Ethnic minorities only make up about 30% of the IT labor force, and this figure is even smaller for women in tech. What are the challenges specific to diversity in the IT industry, and what solutions can be leveraged to improve it? Companies have a golden opportunity to take advantage of change-making benefits when committed to building diverse workforces. Let’s explore how.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Advantages of a Diverse Workforce</em></strong></h2>
<p>The push for corporate diversity reached a fever-pitch as organizations were forced to reckon with their own shortcomings amid the global pandemic and injustices exposed against members of vulnerable communities. Organizations felt compelled to not only show solidarity on social media and marketing campaigns, but also by investing in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs to help establish a paradigm for long-term sustainability. This has not come without its fair share of criticism, which has recently turned many DEI initiatives into a hotbed political issue, leaving some programs subject to defunding or abandoned altogether. Despite the noise, one thing is clear — companies that have diverse workforces outperform their counterparts in a number of key areas. Here’s a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Smarter Decision-Making</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Diversity brings together people of unique perspectives and backgrounds which helps illuminate natural blind spots, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of challenges and solutions. This goes a long way towards improving decision-making throughout an organization, breaking apart the limitations of narrow echo chambers and unchecked biases. As such, inclusive workforces make more than 87% <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/189194/5-ways-diversity-and-inclusion-help-teams-perform-better.html">better decisions</a> compared to non-diverse organizations, leading to increased creativity, problem-solving, and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Talent Pool Expansion</u></em></strong><em> – </em>Especially in the tech industry where staffing shortages are widely reported, focusing on diversity dramatically expands the pool of applicants able to contribute to organizational success. This ensures the best available talent, despite race, gender, age, orientation, etc., have an opportunity to prove their value.<em> </em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Increased Retention</u></em></strong><em> – </em>According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/09/majority-of-workers-who-quit-a-job-in-2021-cite-low-pay-no-opportunities-for-advancement-feeling-disrespected/">Pew Research</a>, one of the top reasons employees leave their companies is disrespect. Non-diverse workplaces often have tendencies towards discrimination and microaggressions, making it difficult for many, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, to fully embrace. A culture of diversity is more welcoming, prioritizing respect of everyone’s background and perspectives, producing deeper commitment across the board.<em> </em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Financial Success</u></em></strong><em> – </em>Companies that embrace gender and ethnic diversity are 39% more <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-matters-even-more-the-case-for-holistic-impact">profitable</a> and 70% more likely to capture new business. This means diversity has ramifications beyond optics, it pays real dividends in increasing financial returns and driving business growth. This extends to executive boardrooms and leadership teams, as organizations with diversity at the top surpass their counterparts in revenue and profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the vast benefits organizations can expect to enjoy when instituting diversity and inclusion as pillars of their company culture, let’s shift focus towards the challenges preventing many in the tech industry from experiencing these competitive advantages.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Challenges to Diversity in the Tech Industry</em></strong></h2>
<p>Diversity in the technology sector has continued to prove difficult, even as more organizations acknowledge the importance of DEI practices. As the field continues to advance with increased digital transformation and next-gen capabilities, what’s keeping the tech industry behind when it comes to diversity? This sector has a storied history of being male-dominated and ethnically underrepresented, which despite <a href="https://readwrite.com/the-importance-of-diversity-and-inclusion-in-building-a-strong-tech-team/">significant efforts</a> from major tech companies such as Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, has barely made a dent in the overall numbers. The issue is multilayered, requiring a holistic approach to truly rectify. Provided are some of the IT industry’s primary challenges to becoming better about diversity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Narrowed Focus</u></em></strong><em> – </em>When sourcing for IT professionals, organizations often select candidates from elite institutions or top companies, drawing a stern barrier for historically marginalized job seekers. For non-traditional applicants, this can prevent valuable skillsets from being acknowledged because of background preferences and overly restrictive candidate pools.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Outdated Hiring Requirements</u></em></strong><em> – </em>In similar fashion, hiring criteria requiring outdated or out-of-scope qualifications can stifle diverse candidate pools. This inadvertently disqualifies candidates who may otherwise be qualified, and encourages a limited pool of qualified applicants.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Leadership Commitment </u></em></strong>– Company culture is established from the top down. Far too often, IT orgs lack leadership figures committed to diversifying their workforces. Whether the reason is inconvenience or lack of perceived value, when decision-makers for hiring and promotions are not dedicated to diversity, it fosters a culture of homogeneity.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Unconscious Bias</u></em></strong><em> – </em>Critical decisions can be impacted by personal biases and lack of awareness, which further exacerbates the diversity gap. More understanding and acknowledgement of these biases is needed to overcome gender and ethnicity disparities that continue to keep the tech industry largely insulated.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Education and Skills Gap</u></em></strong><em> – </em>Educational institutions struggle to keep pace with the rapid advancement of the tech industry, producing many under skilled job seekers entering the IT market. This represents an additional hurdle for diverse candidates, widening existing discrepancies while also creating new ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>As this only represents a handful of the challenges preventing more diversity within the tech sector, it becomes clear why the industry continues to struggle with inclusivity. It takes a concerted effort across numerous focal points to meaningfully address the diversity gap in tech.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Steps in the Right Direction</em></strong></h2>
<p>The good news is proven solutions exist for bridging diversity gaps and creating more inclusive work environments in tech. With focused attention on inclusive practices, organizations can better shape their workforces and reap the myriad of benefits that come with diversity. This should not be viewed as an easy, quick fix, demanding across the board buy-in from C-suite executives to recruiting teams alike. Let’s explore several recommendations to help organizations begin or strengthen their commitment to building diverse workplaces.</p>
<h4>INCLUSIVE RECRUITMENT</h4>
<p>Revising hiring processes with inclusive practices helps eliminate biases and attract a more diverse range of talent. By implementing strategies such as blind recruitment, diverse interview panels, and targeted outreach to underrepresented groups, organizations can create a more equitable hiring environment. These efforts not only help in identifying the best candidates from diverse backgrounds but also contribute to a more welcoming workplace culture.</p>
<h4>DIVERSITY PROGRAMS</h4>
<p>Implementing initiatives to promote enterprise-wide diversity recognizes that varied perspectives are crucial in building inclusive workplaces. These initiatives include leadership development programs for underrepresented groups, setting diversity goals in hiring and career advancement, and fostering an inclusive culture through transparent dialogue and corporate communications. By embedding diversity into every level of the organization, companies create a more inclusive environment that reflects the diversity of their customers and communities.</p>
<h4>TRAINING, EDUCATION, MENTORSHIP</h4>
<p>To enhance company diversity, organizations can invest in training, mentorship, and education programs that support the growth and development of diverse talent. These programs include diversity and inclusion training for all employees to raise awareness and reduce unconscious biases, mentorship programs that connect underrepresented employees with senior leaders for career guidance, and educational opportunities such as workshops and partnerships with diverse institutions. By prioritizing these efforts, companies not only create a more inclusive work environment but also ensure that diverse voices are empowered to thrive and contribute to the organization’s success.</p>
<h4>EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS</h4>
<p>Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are vital in fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace by offering advocacy, networking, and community for employees from diverse backgrounds. These groups provide a platform where individuals can connect, share experiences, and collaborate on initiatives that promote cultural awareness and inclusivity within the organization. ERGs also play a crucial role in advising leadership on diversity-related matters, driving company-wide initiatives, and influencing policies that reflect the needs of underrepresented employees. By empowering ERGs, companies not only enhance employee engagement and retention but also strengthen their commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Diversity Impacts Innovation</em></strong></h2>
<p>Another surprising benefit that comes from diverse workplaces is its influence on innovation and problem-solving. When diverse teams collaborate, they are more likely to challenge the status quo and develop unique solutions that drive business growth and competitiveness. As a result, organizations that prioritize diversity are better equipped to adapt to changing markets and meet the needs of a evolving customer base.</p>
<p>When teams consist of individuals from different cultures, experiences, and viewpoints, they bring a broader range of ideas and approaches to the table. This diversity of thought leads to enhanced creativity, as team members are more likely to challenge conventional thinking and explore novel solutions. Diverse teams draw on their collective knowledge to approach problems from multiple angles, fostering an environment where unique and innovative ideas can flourish.</p>
<p>Moreover, diversity improves team performance and problem-solving capabilities. Teams that are inclusive of different backgrounds tend to be more dynamic and adaptable, leading to better collaboration and communication. This improved synergy enables teams to tackle complex challenges more effectively, as they can leverage their diverse skill sets to find comprehensive solutions. In turn, companies that prioritize diversity are not only more innovative but also better equipped to respond to the evolving demands of their industry, driving sustained success and competitiveness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-governance-market-data-governance-195000489.html">Yahoo Finance</a>, the data governance market is predicted to reach $22.5 billion by 2034, increasing at a 18.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). As this market continues to grow, many enterprises struggle to leverage data assets and insights in an effective and efficient manner. Whether the goal is to enhance operational processes or gain a better understanding of clients and customers, a good data strategy establishes governance, ownership, and desired outcomes for all data. With increased focus on digital transformation, the shift to agile data governance emphasizes the importance of data accuracy and accessibility, standards and regulations, security and storage, as well user demands and business intelligence. Digital transformation creates more troves of insightful data and analytics, making a strong data governance program critical to organizational success.</p>
<h2><strong><em>What is data governance and its pillars?</em></strong></h2>
<p>To explore the intricacies of data governance, it is important to understand its definition and guiding principles that make it impactful in support of digital transformation. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-data-governance-for-enterprise?ef_id=_k_84d509397f9b143f2c936fafe296d956_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmdamuj0pc_SEM__k_84d509397f9b143f2c936fafe296d956_k_&amp;msclkid=84d509397f9b143f2c936fafe296d956">Microsoft</a> states, “Data governance is the system of internal policies that organizations use to manage, access, and secure enterprise data… The goal of the system is to help people efficiently and securely use the vast amounts of data generated by today’s enterprises.” Although systems vary with each organization, common features include internal processes, defined roles, key metrics, and compliance standards. With the increased market pressure to undergo digital transformation, it is pertinent for organizations to leverage existing and newly created strands of data to remain competitive and agile in the evolving landscape of tech empowerment.</p>
<p>As data governance represents a large conceptual approach to effectively manage and utilize data, it can be beneficial to sift through its key components and principles. Industry accepted frameworks such as DAMA-DMBOK are important for standardization and clearly defined principles of what constitutes data governance. For example, the functional areas of data governance according to <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/6/you-cant-have-digital-transformation-without-data-governance">DAMA-DMBOK</a>, which account for its primary elements, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data Architecture</em></li>
<li><em>Data Development</em></li>
<li><em>Database Operations</em></li>
<li><em>Data Security</em></li>
<li><em>Reference &amp; Master Data</em></li>
<li><em>Data Warehousing &amp; Business Intelligence</em></li>
<li><em>Document &amp; Content Management</em></li>
<li><em>Metadata</em></li>
<li><em>Data Quality</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1594 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dmbok_wheel-removebg-preview__1_sniped-removebg-preview-2.png" alt="" width="700" height="755" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dmbok_wheel-removebg-preview__1_sniped-removebg-preview-2.png 700w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dmbok_wheel-removebg-preview__1_sniped-removebg-preview-2-278x300.png 278w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Data Governance serves as the central hub connecting each of these functional areas and ensures accountability across the organization. For data governance to truly work, it must be ingrained throughout all divisions and departments, systematically connected into enterprise-wide operational and technical processes. This means the responsibility of managing a data governance program rests on the shoulders of the collective instead of a singular resource. There are many key roles to be played in the implementation and sustainability of this program.</p>
<p>Next, let’s look at the pillars of data governance and how each principle helps maintain the integrity and usefulness of data lifecycles. Through this framework, organizations can rest assured that comprehensive coverage of data management, utilization and disposal is appropriately addressed. These essential pillars include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Quality</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Ensuring that data is accurate, complete, consistent, and timely. High-quality data is essential for making informed decisions and maintaining trust in the data. This involves metrics and methods for error identification and correction, balanced representation, and continuous validation processes during to uphold data integrity and usefulness.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Administration (Data Stewardship)</u></em></strong> &#8211; Assigning responsibility for data management and ensuring that data stewards are accountable for maintaining data integrity, quality, and privacy. Data stewards enforce data governance policies and procedure.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Security</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other security threats. This includes implementing encryption, access controls, and monitoring systems to safeguard data.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Standards / Ethics</u></em></strong><em> – </em>Practices that comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards. This includes adhering to industry-specific regulations, data protection laws and internal policies. This also includes integrating ethical considerations into data governance to certify data is used responsibly and fairly.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Data Management</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Encompasses the overall management of data as an asset. This includes data architecture, data modeling, metadata management, and data lifecycle management. Effective data management ensures that data is organized, accessible, and usable across the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through understanding these standardized definitions and principles, data governance becomes more manageable and achievable. It provides each key stakeholder in the data governance program with a clearly defined role on both the individual and organizational level. This not only provides key insights and fundamental knowledge, but also establishes a proven framework and roadmap for implementing and maintaining a comprehensive data governance system. With this system in place, organizations can feel empowered gain the most out of their enterprise data.</p>
<h2><strong><em>What are the benefits &amp; challenges of data governance?</em></strong></h2>
<p>Before establishing a full-scale data governance program, organizations want to know if the effort will be worth it. They want assurance that investment of time and resources into building a formal data governance program will yield substantial benefits that can push the organization forward. Here’s a handful of competitive <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-data-governance-for-enterprise?ef_id=_k_1f390f9735d519c3bfe3690196a98dce_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmdamuj0pc_SEM__k_1f390f9735d519c3bfe3690196a98dce_k_&amp;msclkid=1f390f9735d519c3bfe3690196a98dce">advantages</a> to be expected when proper data governance is established:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Single source of truth</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Maintaining a single source of truth ensures that all stakeholders and decision-makers have access to the same, consistent data, which eliminates discrepancies and enhances internal coherence. This alignment enables more accurate and unified decision-making, fostering greater operational flexibility and collaboration across the organization.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Improved data management</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Effective data management, guided by a clear data code of conduct and best practices, enables organizations to address their data needs swiftly and reliably. This structured approach ensures consistency and efficiency in data handling, leading to better resource allocation and quicker responses to business challenges.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Cost optimization</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Consistent data management practices streamline operations, making processes more efficient and reducing redundancies. This operational efficiency not only facilitates smoother audits but also ensures that time and resources are allocated effectively, ultimately reducing costs and enhancing overall productivity.</li>
<li><em><u><strong>Data quality</strong>­</u></em><em> ­- </em>High data quality means that data is accurate, complete, and reliable, which is critical for making informed business decisions. When data is safe to use and consistent, organizations can trust their insights and analyses, leading to better strategic planning and outcomes.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Increased agility</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>A robust data governance strategy, incorporating compliance considerations at every stage, enhances an organization&#8217;s ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. This approach ensures correct data handling and disposal, fostering regulatory compliance and enabling the organization to respond rapidly and effectively to new opportunities and challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>When implemented correctly, organizations can experience each of these benefits in full and unlock newfound efficiencies and business intelligence to support digital transformation and additional strategic initiatives. While considering each of these benefits, it’s also noteworthy to anticipate challenges that may prevent data governance goals and objectives. Some common <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/6/you-cant-have-digital-transformation-without-data-governance">challenges</a> include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>Continuous Data Governance</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Data governance is an ongoing process rather than a one-time project. It encompasses various aspects, such as data sources, integrity, and access, all of which are constantly evolving. Improvement opportunities and priorities may shift over time. While formal projects can facilitate specific enhancements, effective data governance requires continuous improvement and delivery to strategically meet both current and future institutional needs and goals.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Organizational adoption</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>The value of well-governed data is realized only when the organization actively embraces and utilizes it. Data governance thrives when every team member—executive leaders, business stakeholders, and data experts—is empowered through upskilling and collaboration to leverage organizational data effectively.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Defined roles and teamwork</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Defining clear roles and responsibilities within data governance provides clarity on who manages various aspects of the process. Titles such as chief data officer or data steward can be designated, with each organization determining the most suitable team structure based on their needs and resources. This clarity promotes better adoption and teamwork.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Siloed data</u></em></strong><em> &#8211;</em> Internal divisions in data gathering can create silos, leading to isolated data that may become duplicated or inconsistent when unified. Cleaning and preparing data is essential for successful data governance. Quality input data ensures quality output data. Addressing silos is crucial to preventing fragmentation and enhancing data consistency.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Formalized approach / methodology</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>Without leveraging a proven framework or a champion advocating for a thorough methodology, gaining the broad support needed for a successful data governance initiative can be challenging. Executive-level support is vital to persuade other leaders of the necessity for improvements and collaboration which fully actualizes the benefits of data governance.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Preparedness</u></em></strong><em> &#8211; </em>There can be hesitation to start data governance initiatives, even when elements of data management are already in place. Assessing existing practices and determining next steps are critical first steps. For an institution to benefit from data governance, it is essential to begin the process and remain open to change, despite the inherent difficulties associated with change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges should be expected when embarking on any new enterprise-wide initiative, especially addressing as complex a system as data governance. The best way to overcome these challenges is head on, as avoidance and complacency makes matters worse, leaving organizations severely behind competitors who decide to take advantage of the ranging benefits provided by data governance. Even a small step forward is better than inaction when it comes to data governance and digital transformation.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Rise of AI in data governance</em></strong></h2>
<p>In the sophisticated landscape of data management and digital transformation, it’s important to analyze current and future developments, especially the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The adoption of <a href="https://theodi.cdn.ngo/media/documents/Understanding_data_governance_in_AI__Mapping_governance.pdf">AI capabilities</a> into data governance programs is proving valuable in the collection, clean-up and analysis of enterprise data as well as driving real-time decision making and compliance with data policies and industry standards. Furthermore, the introduction of natural language processing and ML algorithms helps automate specific tasks and provide comprehensive independent insights with minimal need of human interference. This not only frees up valuable time and resources, but also provides an added layer of quality control to ensure all data is properly evaluated and organized. Overall, the ability to leverage AI and ML makes the process for implementing and maintaining a data governance program more efficient and effective.</p>
<p>When correctly integrated, AI and ML unleashes a host of benefits to empower organizational data governance. This includes locating, classifying and categorizing targeted data to enhance business intelligence and reducing data vulnerabilities and inconsistencies. Improving the process for organizing data and ensuring quality standards provides more precise understanding of the organizational innerworkings and the 1ability to forecast upcoming developments. It brings visibility into important organizational processes and performance across otherwise distant and siloed environments. This alleviates the more laborious components of data entry and analysis, allowing for data professionals to focus on larger strategic and programmatic concerns.</p>
<p>With such expansive capabilities, organizations must ensure AI and ML adhere to high ethical standards, liberated from biases which can malign the impact of these technologies. In 2017 alone, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-create-a-business-case-for-data-quality-improvement">Gartner</a>, inaccurate data costs organizations an average of $15 million annually, a figure that can be exacerbated by biased AI models which have far-reaching ripples due to its agility and pervasiveness. As such, non-biased, ethical AI systems require sensitivity analysis, fairness testing, and explainable AI to prevent discriminatory outcomes and proliferation of low-quality, incorrect data. This requires organizations establish protective safeguards around emerging technologies before blindly incorporating these tools, a necessary inconvenience that saves the integrity of enterprise data immediately and over the course of time.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Data Quality &#8211; Security and Compliance</em></strong></h2>
<p>Another major component of data quality is protection from cyber threats and compliance to industry standards. Protection from bad actors prevents intentional manipulation, corruption and theft of data critical to organizational success. As digital transformation and technical capabilities expand, there’s a twofold effect happening with the potency of cyber attacks and resources available to cyber criminals aiming to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise sensitive data. Data security must be thoroughly integrated into an effective data governance program to mitigate these risks and protect against the persistent threat of bad actors.</p>
<p>Robust data security requires proactive threat detection, incident response and continuous monitoring. This ensures key protections are in place to thwart the effectiveness of cyber threats before they occur and actionable steps are taken when a data breach happens. Although the best line of defense is prevention, organizations must be prepared for worst case scenarios and know how to address a compromised environment to ensure continuity of services and protection from additional damage. Adopting proven controls and countermeasures established by trusted entities such as NIST and CISA provides helpful frameworks and recommendations needed to keep organizations across all industries safe. Addressing data security with proven cybersecurity frameworks strengthens the integrity of data governance programs, and as a result, the entire organization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, data quality and cyber protections helps organizations remain in compliance with industry standards and regulations. For example, regulations such as FISMA for financial services and HIPAA for healthcare require organizations to adhere to stringent criteria which can be misaligned by poor data quality or exposed vulnerabilities. With proper data governance, organizations can account for the nuances of compliance to industry regulations, and rest assured that they are meeting the standards impressed upon them without being at risk for penalty or sanction. To further support compliance, continuous monitoring is needed to regularly ensure processes, practices, and environments of an organization remain compliant as standards and regulations continue to evolve. As standards change, organizations can more readily adapt when continuous monitoring is implemented into their data governance strategy and unlock the full potential digital transformation offers in making insightful business decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Done are the days when IT groups can afford to operate independently of larger business concerns. In today’s competitive technology landscape, IT leaders are increasingly relied upon to strengthen bottom line through cost optimization and business growth activities. When in-sync with the business, IT groups can enhance enterprise-wide capabilities that makes processes easier to serve external and internal customers. Strategic technology consolidation and investment helps support calculated revenue growth and improved productivity overall. With a robust IT cost optimization strategy, IT leaders may not only assist in the elusive push for cost-savings, but more so, develop a vehicle for organizational advancement, driving business from point A to point B and beyond.</p>
<h2><strong>What is IT cost optimization?</strong></h2>
<p>Cost optimization is often misinterpreted for simply cutting costs and eliminating redundancies. While these may represent key focal points, it fails to provide the full picture of cost optimization. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/insights/cost-optimization">Gartner</a>, “Cost optimization is a business-focused, continuous discipline to drive spending and cost reduction, while maximizing business value.” This balancing act of trimming expenses while simultaneously expanding growth is the essence of cost optimization. In IT cost optimization specifically, business technology and its processes become the central crux of cost-efficiently maximizing business value. This includes evaluation of cloud services, digital and physical architecture, technology networks, software applications, security apparatus, artificial intelligence, automation tools and more.</p>
<p>IT cost optimization is a financial strategy, hinged on the relationship between IT spending and business value. The key to unlocking IT cost optimization is reducing spending while maintaining or improving technical functionality, performance, and productivity. With proper implementation and commitment to IT cost optimization, enterprises can spawn a wealth of wide-ranging benefits, such as improved ROI and spending, enhanced agility and innovation, stronger business alignment and risk mitigation, as well as overall competitive advantage. As such, it becomes more evident initiatives focused on IT cost optimization are critical to generating success and longevity.</p>
<h2><strong>Strategies for IT Cost Optimization</strong></h2>
<p>Once organizational leaders prioritize IT cost optimization, what strategies can be used to accomplish this goal? IT cost optimization can be complicated by internal capabilities, technology infrastructure and the unique business operations of any given enterprise. A concerted effort from IT and Business leaders is needed to steer cost-savings and foster greater business value. Some organizations choose to navigate this space independently relying on internal talent if capable, while others may decide to collaborate with a third-party vendor to supplement manpower and expertise. In either scenario, careful planning and execution is needed to provide a roadmap for success.</p>
<p>The complexities of IT cost optimization can be simplified with the guidance of proven <a href="https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/apm/it-cost-optimization">frameworks</a> and strategies. This blueprint allows decision makers to account for each intersection of their technology environment and processes, alongside fiscal responsibilities for revenue generation and spending reduction. Provided below are focal points of this framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>IT Landscape Mapping</strong> – </em>Before optimization can take place, an accurate inventory of IT infrastructure is needed to provide visibility. This may include IT hardware, software, networking, cloud operations, cybersecurity protections, etc. In the mapping process, stakeholders can evaluate lifecycle stage, usage, business value, and risk.</li>
<li><em><strong>Business Capability Mapping</strong> – </em>Similar to the aforementioned, Business Capability Mapping accounts for the functions, environment, and processes that the business relies upon to operate and provide goods/services. This map demonstrates the applications, data flows, and business value for each business unit. It is to assess the underpinnings of the business structure and value, and identify overage, redundancies and other inefficiencies.</li>
<li><em><strong>Financial Transparency</strong> – </em>This communicates how IT spending impacts overall business value. It can be achieved when all key IT and business stakeholders have a singular source of visibility into the financing of their IT landscape. IT visibility encourages ongoing analysis of technology and project investments.</li>
<li><em><strong>Implementation</strong> – </em>This involves prioritizing investments that deliver high ROI and align with business goals while also leveraging technologies such as cloud computing or cybersecurity for efficiency gains and long-term cost savings. Additionally, fostering a culture of cost-consciousness within IT units promotes innovative solutions and responsible resource management, ensuring sustained optimization over time.</li>
<li><em><strong>Continuously Monitoring</strong> – </em>Constant evaluation and reevaluation of resources, processes, and assets is needed to effectively maintain IT cost optimization. With effective commitment, key stakeholders can remain aligned on the relationship between business and IT processes as well as maximize opportunities for optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>As demonstrated, to achieve IT cost optimization organizational leaders have several strategic actions to take. This includes comprehensive IT and business landscape mappings, financial transparency to provide spending visibility, implementation to actualize cost-cutting and calculated investment, as well as continuous monitoring to remain dedicated to optimization efforts and opportunities. When executed properly, this creates a company culture of optimization and business growth.</p>
<h2><strong>Optimizing IT Processes </strong></h2>
<p>A major component of IT cost optimization is the transformation of processes to improve IT-Business alignment. Dedicated collaboration between IT and Business units enables organizations to achieve digital and financial goals. As such, organizations are increasingly adopting Agile and DevOps approaches to improve efficiencies, quality and speed in accomplishing technology goals and objectives. In conjunction with these delivery methods, automation also optimizes IT capabilities, facilitating cost-savings and business expansion. Through automation and iterative delivery models, organizations can more readily address project backlogs and production goals.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/financial-services/five-areas-of-focus-for-it-cost-optimization">Ernst &amp; Young</a>, IT leaders can improve the efficiency of their IT processes and promote IT cost optimization by leveraging:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Process Automation</strong> – </em>Automation of IT and business processes such as workflows, data collection, threat detection, cloud computing, invoicing, etc., increases efficiencies in daily tasks and critical operations.</li>
<li><em><strong>Agile / DevOps</strong> – </em>These methodologies and supportive technologies foster shorter, iterative delivery cycles, enhancing the execution of development and testing activities. This allows for better precision of delivered value and timely response to real-time challenges or opportunities for improvement.</li>
<li><em><strong>Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning</strong> – </em>AI and machine learning augmentation can aid in the support and delivery of wide-ranging operations and tasks, including design, coding, analysis, cyber protections and more.</li>
<li><em><strong>Demand Management</strong> –</em> Involves aligning technology resources and services with business needs to efficiently allocate resources and control expenses. This helps prioritize IT projects and requests, while also assessing capacity based on current demands.</li>

Moving to the cloud can be a daunting task that comes with a host of technology and personnel challenges, but if done correctly, offers innumerable benefits in the growth, productivity, and ultimately, cost-savings of any organization.</p>
<h2>Rise of Cloud Migration Efforts</h2>
<p>In recent years, the number of organizations across industries and service areas embracing cloud migration has increased significantly. With over 22% year over year growth, the market size for <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/14/2743442/0/en/Cloud-Migration-Services-Market-worth-58-24-Billion-by-2030-Exclusive-Report-by-The-Insight-Partners.html">cloud migration services</a> was valued at $11 billion in 2023, and is projected to reach about $60 billion by 2030. From healthcare and financial services to power/energy and transportation, adopters are finding tremendous value in supplementing or outright replacing on-prem systems for cloud computing services. A shortlist of benefits includes added data storage, security, accessibility, disaster recovery and sustainability. With cloud migration, organizations are greatly transforming their business operations and technical capabilities.</p>
<p>In the past, migrating to the cloud was more of a foreign process with limited market insights and case studies available. Although replacement of on-prem legacy systems still represent a noteworthy challenge, because of general cloud education and exposure, there’s a higher baseline of users already familiar with a variety of cloud services. You do not have to look any further than iCloud, DropBox, Google Drive, One Drive, etc., to understand the commercialization of cloud services, priming organizational users for cloud adoption.</p>
<p>With most users ready, what’s preventing organizations from migrating to cloud, and how can you best prepare your organization for this change-making move?</p>
<h2>Cloud Migration Preparedness</h2>
<p>Organizations must question their readiness and business goals when preparing to migrate to the cloud. Examine your exact needs and expectations in pursuing cloud services and forecast how these services will not only benefit your organization, but more pointedly, help accomplish desired business and technology outcomes set forth by your company. Aligning cloud adoption to specific end goals helps maximize capabilities and tailor overall strategy for implementing this powerful technology. Performing a SWOT analysis is a recommended first step to understanding the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with cloud migration specific to your organization.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.govtech.com/cloud-different/the-state-of-cloud-in-state-and-local-governments">Gov Tech</a>, government leaders in technology have cited several challenges with cloud adoption, including measuring ROI, proper security controls, upskilling staff, and complex legacy environments. Although these areas may cause legitimate concern, which requires collaboration from key IT and business stakeholders to address and navigate, it also presents an opportunity to improve and enhance organizational capabilities and efficiencies.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Return on Investment (ROI):</u> Measuring ROI on cloud migrations is trickier than simply switching over and saving money. The establishment and/or maintenance of an on-prem data center must be compared to the pay-as-you-go subscription model of a third-party cloud service provider. On-prem environments require specialized licenses and data center resources to implement, monitor, and scale equipment, which may be a sizable expense depending on the organization. Whereas implementation and scaling with a cloud provider typically requires less upfront financial and planning commitments. To understand the true ROI of cloud migration, organizations must weigh the quantitative and qualitative returns they may gain against the cost of migration and historic investment into on-prem legacy systems.</li>
<li><u>Legacy Systems:</u> At the heart of cloud migration is the transfer of legacy systems into a cloud environment. This includes components, controls, data, and other key enterprise architecture that must transition or evolve to fit cloud functionality. For Government organizations, tied to strict regulations and accountable to the needs of taxpayers, legacy systems have been deeply entrenched undergoing only incremental changes, and notably challenged against complete transformation. This apprehension may be due to the costs and labor of a large migration effort, with massive data loads and historical functionality at-risk. It may also be due to historic investment, the yearly budgets spent developing and maintaining on-prem systems, which must be substantially justified in the eyes of key stakeholders before transitioning to the cloud. Added to this concern may be strict guidelines around data control and the high need for customization. It leaves many Government organizations wondering, will a cloud migration be worth it?</li>
<li><u>Security:</u> On-prem systems require in-house cybersecurity resources to monitor and respond to incidents that may occur, as well as maintain and update security software and protocols. This grants organizations full control over their security measures, personnel and strategy, but also full accountability if breached. In comparison, cloud systems are protected and managed by third-party service providers with minimal involvement from purchasers. Cloud security is marked by highly experienced resources alongside the latest deployment of cybersecurity controls and technologies such as automated response, business continuity/disaster recovery, artificial intelligence and machine learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding your organizational infrastructure, performance goals, and compliance with regulatory requirements is central to knowing if cloud migration is the right move for you. Carefully analyze ROI, legacy systems and security controls to fully align your enterprise needs with cloud strategy. If you discover alignment between your organization and cloud services, there are a host of transformative migration strategies and benefits ready to be embraced.</p>
<h2>Understanding Migration Strategies</h2>
<p>Choosing the right migration strategy is a key component in ensuring a successful transition into the cloud. This determines the approach and scope of cloud adoption, tailored to the precise technology hardware and software infrastructure of your organization. These proven <a href="https://www.devteam.space/blog/how-to-undertake-legacy-system-migration/">migration strategies</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Lift and Shift</u>: With this approach, IT systems are completely transferred to the cloud. This fully replaces on-prem infrastructure and moves organizations into the cloud entirely. Consider this strategy if you require minimal customization and would like a one-to-one of your current state on the cloud.</li>
<li><u>Application Evolution</u>: This moves IT infrastructure to the cloud in a gradual progression, transferring data and systems chunk by chunk until satisfaction is reached. This hybrid approach allows for the simultaneous usage of cloud computing and on-prem systems for selected technologies and data.</li>
<li><u>Application Rearchitecting</u>: If legacy systems require significant updating before a cloud migration, you may want to consider application rearchitecting. This includes rebuilding existing applications with modern advancements that allow for added scalability and agility. This also allows for a hybrid approach balanced between cloud and on-prem services, although organizations can also choose a complete transfer as well with this strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember migration strategies are not one size fits all, and highly dependent on the structure and needs of your organization. As mentioned earlier, moving to the cloud can be a daunting task, that involves collaboration between key stakeholders, an organizational assessment, roadmap for execution, and the technical capability to make it happen. The good news is you do not have to approach it alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the unprecedented SolarWinds cyber-attack that breached thousands of organizations, the U.S. Government entered a new frontier in addressing the evolution and effectiveness of cyber threats. In response, the Government <a href="https://fedtechmagazine.com/article/2023/03/keep-software-supply-chains-secure-new-federal-guidance">prioritized</a> securing the software supply chain in a concerted, interdepartmental effort to protect citizens, agencies, businesses, and critical infrastructure. As cyber-attacks continue to mature, through the advancement of technology such as generative artificial intelligence, the importance of protecting the software supply chain has been a prominent concern. Just as important, one could argue, is the public-private sector partnerships needed to effectively address these threats.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding the software supply chain</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/mace-protecting-government-it-systems-is-critical-to-federal-software-supply-chain/">U.S. Representatives</a> have continued to ring the alarm bell on the importance of protecting the nation’s software supply chain. What exactly is this supply chain, and why does it need protection?</p>
<p>Traditionally, supply chain represents the journey of raw materials into a physical product delivered to consumers. This includes anything from food and automobiles to apparel and smartphones.</p>
<p>The software supply chain relates to the “materials” that create IT applications and systems. This includes building blocks of code, configurations, open-source binaries, plugins, etc. These foundational elements are the backbone of digital and web-based functionality.</p>
<p>With digital transformation and our increased reliance on technology solutions to accomplish critical tasks, such as financial transactions, power generation, water treatment, air travel, medical services, etc., the need to protect each part of the software supply chain has emerged as a chief priority. Consider the speed of internet/online communications and scope of databases housing sensitive data. The need to protect the software supply chain is paramount in safeguarding essential services from bad actors.</p>
<h2><strong>Software supply chain vulnerabilities</strong></h2>
<p>As our societies and services have become more digitalized, the number and efficacy of cyber threats have risen. Each successful breach acts as a clarion call for cyber-attackers to double down on their nefarious efforts and hunt for organizational vulnerabilities. The list of victims is exhaustive, impacting Federal, State and Local Government, healthcare providers, educational institutions, financial services companies, media conglomerates, casino operators and much more. Finding an unimpacted industry may be the more difficult task. According to the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/springfield/news/internet-crime-complaint-center-releases-2022-statistics">FBI</a>, cybercrime amassed over $10 billion in financial losses in 2022 alone. These damages put into the perspective the massive scale of cyber-criminality and the need to protect overlooked vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals are getting smarter in exploiting technology and procedural weaknesses. Amongst many targets, they search for outdated systems, weak passwords, inadequate firewalls, accessible endpoints and unsuspecting individuals to gain access to sensitive data. Their aggressive methods can range from notorious ransomware—delivered as Phishing attacks or DDoS attacks which may completely interrupt services of a targeted system or technology—to more covert spyware which is used to mirror keystrokes and lift privileged credentials without alerting potential victims until it’s already too late. As cybercriminals become more prolific in their capabilities, increasing the depth and breadth of their attacks, it puts organizations more at-risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Protecting the software supply chain</strong></h2>
<p>Now, why are proven cybersecurity protections and collaboration efforts between the U.S. Government and private industry so important? This <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">collaboration</a> aims to bring together the best minds in cybersecurity and business, sharing key insights to strengthen security posture nationwide.</p>
<p>“Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector,” the White House said. “The private sector must adapt to the continuously changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace.”</p>
<p>Recently, it was announced that a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/11/27/biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-resilience-center-protect-us">new DHS Center</a> will be launched in 2024 to, “collaborate with the private sector to better secure our supply chains. The SCRC will analyze vulnerabilities and conduct scenario planning with private sector stakeholders to help mitigate supply chain disruptions, ensure reliable and efficient deliveries of goods and services, and lower costs for the American people.”</p>
<p>Through this public-private partnership, a more robust security posture may be developed to protect critical digital infrastructure and essential services.</p>
<p>What are some proven recommendations to enhance these protections? According to <a href="https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2023/08/01/six-steps-to-safeguarding-government-software-amid-rising-threats/">Federal Times</a>, organizations should consider adopting the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Software scanning services / continuous monitoring:</u> Threat detection is among the first lines of defense against cyber threats. Through scanning/monitoring of applications and systems, visibility is gained into the active state of your digital environment.</li>
<li><u>Identity and Access Management:</u> Authentication tools are a valuable safeguard against bad actors. Controls such as duo factor authenticators and encrypted privileges help ensure a closed network of access to important data and capabilities.</li>
<li><u>Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML):</u> As cybercriminals leverage the power of AI/ML, organizations must be proactive in keeping pace. AI/ML makes a variety of tasks easier and more efficient, such as threat detection and automated incident response.</li>
<li><u>Automation</u>: These tools allow organizations to scale their cybersecurity measures with autonomous technology, ensuring threat detection, vulnerability assessment and incident response are activated without manual input.</li>
<li><u>Zero Trust Architecture:</u> With this model, each transaction is assumed to be a threat and handled with a proactive, responsive posture. This also includes the enhancement of access controls and continuous verification for all endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, a magic bullet to address software supply chain vulnerabilities does not exist. It takes a comprehensive, robust approach with proven controls, countermeasures, and strategic recommendations from reputable organizations such as CISA, NIST, DHS, Gartner, etc. To implement these protections and enhance security posture, agencies, authorities and business enterprises should consider partnering with a trusted IT Consulting provider such as <a href="/website/industry-expertise/#government">Web Sharp Studios</a>.</p>

<p>Implementation of cybersecurity protections and continued vigilance is needed to protect the software supply chain and critical infrastructure from bad actors. Over time with the progression of technological capabilities, these threats will not vanish, but only grow stronger and more complex. It is the responsibility of the Government and the best of private industry to continue working together to address the changing threat landscape. Through public-private sector collaboration, effective solutions can be established to safeguard against attacks to the software supply chain.</p>
